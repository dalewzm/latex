\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}
%\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\ding{43}}
The study of networks has emerged in diverse disciplines as a means of analyzing complex relational data. 
The earliest known paper in this field is the famous Seven Bridges of Konigsberg written by Leonhard Euler in 1736.
 Euler's mathematical description of vertices and edges was the foundation of graph theory, a branch of mathematics
 that studies the properties of pairwise relations in a network structure. The field of graph theory continued to develop
 and found applications in chemistry.\cite{1}\\

With the development of network study, network science has been a hot research field in recent years. Network science 
is an interdisciplinary academic field which studies complex networks such as telecommunication networks, computer
 networks, biological networks, cognitive and semantic networks, and social networks. The field draws on theories 
 and methods including graph theory from mathematics, statistical mechanics from physics, data mining and information
 visualization from computer science, inferential modeling from statistics, and social structure from sociology.\\

 \indent
In this problem, we focus on using networks to measure influence and impact. In research networks, one of the techniques 
to determine influence of academic research is to build and measure properties of citation or co-author networks. 
Citation between papers and co-authoring between   researchers are the most common relationship in research networks.
 Identifying influential papers or researchers in academic networks is very meaningful for people to quickly understand
 related academic fields. Our goal for ICM 2014 is to analyze influence and impact in research networks and other 
 areas of society.\\


\subsection{Breaking Down the Problem}
After analyzing the problem, we conclude five main sub-problems to tackle in our paper:
\begin{itemize}
\item Build the co-author network of the Erdos1 authors and analyze the properties of this network. 
\item  Develop influence measures to determine the most influential Erdos1    author
\item  Compare the relative significance of a research paper by analyzing related works
\item Implement the algorithm on a different set of network influence data
\item Discuss the science, understanding and utility of modeling influence and impact within networks
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Our Work}
To tackle the first problem, we use a set of parameters to build the co-author network of the Erdos1 authors with basic
 assumptions and then conduct the properties analysis.
As for the second and third tasks, we want to use the Weighted Page Rank Network Influence Model (WPRNLM) to measure
 the influence and impact within research networks. With corresponding network influence data, we will figure out the most
 influential Erdos1 author and determine the most influential paper in network science. In addition, we will further discuss the
 model applicability to generic network influence-ranking problems.
To deal with the fourth question, we plan to implement our model on network influence of movie actors. To achieve better 
and more reliable results, we restrict the network to only ten famous Hong Kong and Taiwan movie actors. Then we use the
 algorithm in WPRNLM to work out the most influential movie actor within this network.
Finally, we apply our model into practice within networks. In this case, we focus on how to maximize the network-based 
influence based on max-degree algorithm. To explain the application, we present two specific examples in life. We also 
discuss in detail on how to optimize our model by adding the new algorithm.

%===============================合作者网络==============================================
\subsection{Basic Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Only taking the total influence of the important articles into consideration when determining 
author’s original influence. We use H-index to measure the original influence of one author. H-index 
connotes the quantity of important papers in academic research as a scientist has index h if h of his/her
 Np papers have at least h citations each, and the other (Np ? h) papers have no more than h
 citations each.
 \item To define the Erdos number, Erdos alone was assigned the Erdos number of 0 (for being himself), 
 while his immediate collaborators could claim an Erdos number of 1, their collaborators have Erdos 
 number at most 2, and so on.
\item When calculating the attached influence, we only consider the relationship between Erdor1 
authors in the method of weighting and ignore the influence of other Erdor2 authors.
\item Use only cooperation times to describe the line between two authors regardless of the 
intensity and effect of each cooperation.
\item Neglect the impact of interference factor outside the network.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Definition}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Node:} Person who has co-author with Erdos1, every person is a  rectangle with a number aside
\item \textbf{Link:} Cooperation between  Erdor1 authors


\end{itemize}
\subsection{Establishment}
     We get data from website supported, the list of  511 coauthors of Paul Erdos, together with their coauthors
listed beneath them, we only take  relationship between the  Erdor1 authors.

		  this network's density is 0.01258 \\  
\item \textbf{Betweenness Centrality:}a measure of a node's centrality in a network equal to the number of shortest paths
from all vertices to all others that pass through that node (Freeman et, al., 1979).	  \\
	The betweenness centrality of node is defined as following:	  \\
	\begin{equation}
       C_{B}(i)=\sum\limits_{s\ne i \ne t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(i)}{\sigma_{st}}
	 \end{equation} 
	 Where $\sigma_{st}$ is the total number of shortest paths from node s to node t and $\sigma_{st}(v )$ is the number of those paths
that pass through node i .
\item \textbf{Edge Betweenness:} the number of shortest paths between pairs of nodes that run along it (Girvan M. et, al.,
2002). The edges that connect communities in the network have high edge betweenness.

\section{P-Rank Network Model } 
\subsection{Model Description}
The inspiration about how to establish the model to figure out the influence of the network comes 
from Page Rank algorithm.We introduce double-weighting factor based on the Page Rank algorithm to make
 it more suitable to figure out the influence of the network.\\
\phantom{niha}In our model, every person's influence is determined by three part 
\begin{itemize}
\item The sum of the votes on its connections with other important reseracher in Erdos1 network
\item  The number of  person own publications
\item  Times he co-autherd with Erdos
\end{itemize}
 Then we do some \textbf{Symbol definition} as follows:\\
 \begin{table}[H]
\centering
 \rowcolors{2}{regular!20}{regular!10} 
 \begin{tabular}{cc}  
 \rowcolor{regular!30} Symbol &Meaning\\
    S         &    the composite influence of a node \\
     O    &      the origin influence of a node\\
     A&       attached influence of other nodes\\
     p                  &        double-weighting factor\\
     $S_{i}$                   &          S of the ith author\\
     $O_{i}$                   &          O of the ith author\\
     $A_{i}$                   &         A of the ith author\\
     $H_{i}$                   &         the h-index of the ith author\\
     H                     &        the sum of the h-index of 511 authors  \\
     m                    &         the number of the author who cooperate with the ith author \\
     $S_{ij}$                   &         the S of  author j in m authors cooperated with i \\
     $CT_{ij}$      &           cooperation time  between the  author j  and i\\
 \end{tabular}
 \end{table}   
\subsection{Modeling Methodology }
\begin{itemize}
\item  Each person's vote is proportional to the importance of its source co-auther
\item   If person P with importance X has n co-authors, auther j have co-autherd with P $CT_{j}$ times,
            auther j will get influence $\frac{XCT_{j}}{\sum_{0<i<n}CT_{i} }$ from P
\item   If person P  cooperate with  Erdos, $CT_{p}$ times, he will get influence $\frac{CT_{p}}{\sum_{0<i<n}CT_{i}}$
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Influence Measures and Algorithm }
Matrix M has one row and one column for each author
Suppose person j has n partners \cite{3}
    \boldmath
\begin{equation}
M_{ij}=\begin{cases}
\frac{CT_{ji} }{\sum\limits_{0<k<n } CT_{jk}}, & if j \to i;\\
0, & others
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\textbf{M} is a \textbf{column stochastic matrix}, which columns sum to 1\\
\textbf{s,o} both are vectors with one entry per person \\
$s_{i} $~is the influence score of person i, call it the rank vector,$| s | $= 1  \\
$o_{i}$~is the own influence of person i, $o_{i}=\frac{h_{i}}{H}$ ,$| o | $= 1 \\


we use \textbf{Power Iteration method:}\\
Suppose there are N person\\
\textbf{Initialize:} $s_{0} = [1/N,….,1/N]^{T}$ \\
\textbf{Iterate: } $s^{k+1}$ = B$s^{k}$  \\
\textbf{Stop :}when$ |s^{k+1} - s^{k}|_{1} <\epsilon$ ,$ |x|_{1}~ is~ the~ L_{1} ~norm $ \\
~\\
   
$B_{ij} = (1-p)M_{ij} + po_{i} $ \\
$ s_{i} = \sum\limits_{1\le j \le N } B_{ij} s_{j} $ \\
$s_{i} = \sum\limits_{1 \le j \le N } [ ~ (1-p)M_{ij} + po_{i} ~ ] s_{j}$ \\
  $    = (1-p)\sum\limits_{1 \le j \le N } M_{ij} s_{j} + po_{i}\sum\limits_{1 \le j \le N } s_{j} $\\
  $    = (1-p) \sum\limits_{1 \le j \le N }M_{ij} r_{j} + po_{i}, since |s| = 1$\\
$s =(1-p)Ms + po$
\unboldmath
\subsection{Figuring Out the Most Influential Author}
To figure out the most influential Erdos1 author in our network, we assume each node represents
 an Erdos1 author. The sum influence of each node equals to original influence ($O_{I}$) plus attached 
 influence ($A_{I}$). As long as two authors have cooperated for at least one time, we think there is a 
 link between them. \cite{2} For author i in our network, we can calculate his sum influence using the 
 following formula: 
 \begin{equation}
 S_{i}=p*O_{i}+(1-p)*A_{i} 
  \end{equation}
   \begin{equation}
 O_{i}=\frac{h_{i}}{H}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
 A_{i}=\sum\limits_{j=1}^{m}S_{ij}\frac{CT_{ij}}{\sum\limits_{j=1}^{m}CT_{ij}}
 \end{equation}
We use PRNM model to figure out the rank of 511 authors when p changes from 0.1 to 0.9,and find out authors
 who always appear in top10 when p changes
 And then we draw the figure about them as figure\ref{fig:rank}.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

  \doublebox{\includegraphics[width=6in]{2.jpg}}
\caption{Influence ranking for 2 most influencial Edors1 authors}
\label{fig:rank}
\end{figure}
During the process of p changes,ALON , NOGA M and BOLLOBAS, BELA are always appear in top10 ,so we can conclude that
ALON , NOGA M and BOLLOBAS, BELA are the most influencial authors.

\subsection{Most Influential Paper in Network Science}
In order to understand the problem better,we draw the network of 16 papers' citation relationship as figure\eqref{fig:gra}:
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
 \setlength{\fboxsep}{0pt}

\doublebox{\includegraphics[width=12cm]{graph.pdf}}
\caption{Topological order of paper network}
\label{fig:gra}
\end{figure}
To find out the most influential paper among the 16 given papers, we make some assumptions:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Assuming that each paper has an initial relative influence number 1\\
\item Assuming that paper A is cited by paper B, then we call B has one citation number of 1 from A, and
 the influence factor of the relative influence in network from B to A is 15/16; and if B is cited by C, 
 then C has a citation number of 2 from A, and the influence factor of the relative influence in network 
 from C to A is 14/16; and so on. The distribution of the influence factor is as follows: \\
 $$ \text{factor} = -\frac{ \text{Citation~ number}}{16}+1 $$
 \item Calculating the minimum citation number’s influence caused by other papers when calculate 
 the paper’s relative influence in network. For instance: paper A is cited by paper B and B both has 
 citation number 1 and citation number 2, and when calculate the influence of A, only the citation
 number 1of B is relative, which is the minimum citation number.
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}
\text{Paper’s ~comparative~ influence}=1+\sum\limits_{1\le i \le m }n_{i}*f_{i}
\end{equation}
where $n_{i}$ is the independent paper number which is cited \textbf{i} times by this paper, $f_{i}$ is the
 influence factor of citation number i, \textbf{m }is the maximum citation number
According to this method, the relative influence of these 16 papers is as figure \eqref{fig:data}:\\


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=6in]{data.jpg}
\caption{}
\label{fig:data}
\end{figure}

In this figure, the 14th paper has maximum relative influence among these 16 papers\cite{4}
 \subsection{Applicability to Generic Network Influence-Ranking Problems}
We make some changes in the measuring network influence model that we established to let it meet
 the demand of obtaining the relative influence of each paper in the paper network model. Similarly,
 we change some parameters and apply the model to other networks in the real world. For example:
 when calculate a scholar’s influence in a network, 
 we use the equation―“the overall influence=p×original influence＋(1-p)×attached influence” 
 to get each scholar’s influence by iteration ( the original influence is represented by each scholar’s
 research achievements, and the attached influence is obtained by the weight distribution of the overall
 influence of other scholars that have a collaboration relationship to this scholar). \cite{5}As for obtaining the
 influence of a school, department or a journal in the network, it needs the parameters and the
 relationship’s mathematic description to be fixed, and we can use the model we established too.
 For instance, when we set up a network in which the school is regarded as the node to obtain the
 research influence of each school, and then the school’s original influence is its own research 
 achievements, and the amount of co-achievements with other schools is represented as the weighted 
 index from other schools. And next, we use the weighted page rank algorithm to get each school’s
 influence in the network. Hence, we only need to collect each school’s independent research 
 achievements and use some corresponding data to represent them, and then gather the amount of 
 co-achievements with other schools, and finally the work of studying the network relationship figure
 among schools is finished.

\section{Implementing the Model on Network Influence of Movie Actors}
\subsection{Introduction}
To test the validity of our model and algorithm derived from academic research networks, we apply 
PRNM to a totally different movie actor collaboration network.
To simplify the mode l and have an accurate result, we limit the scope of our movie actor collaboration
 network within ten famous Taiwan and Hong Kong actors, Shawn Yue、Simon Yam、Kot Eric、
 Anthony　Perry、Francis　NG、Eric Tsang、Tommy Tam、Andy Lau、Daniel Wu and Bowie Tsang. 
 They have good fame among the movie collaboration network for they have tight relationship between
 each other and they are known well by a lot of movie fans.
We find relevant actor collaboration data from a famous online film community on the Internet―Mtime,
 a website co-constructed by technical experts from overseas and some domestic senior media
 professionals. Compared to the famous IMDB website which provides the search service of the film
 database, Mtime has a comparatively complete collection of Chinese movies so it is more suitable
 for the Chinese film network research.\cite{6}
\subsection{Network of Ten Movie Actors }
In the process of constructing network, a node represents an actor, and if two of these actors appeared in one film, we use one undirected weighted edge to connect the two corresponding nodes. 
The following figure is the network of these ten movie actors fig\eqref{fig:aa}:
\begin{figure}[H]
\small
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{actor.jpg}
\caption{Actor Network} \label{fig:aa}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Influence Measures of Movie Actors}
Influence Measures of Movie Actors
According to our model, the sum influence of each actor in the actor collaboration network is given by the following formula:
Sum influence equals to original influence plus attached influence (measured by collaboration times)
\begin{equation}
S_{i}=p*O_{i}+(1-p)*A_{i}
\end{equation}
The original influence of one actor means his own influence in the film circle, according to the data
 in Mtime, we can find a pie chart about the relative influence of these ten actors, which are
 measured by public voting, and then we turn the percentage numbers into specific decimals.\\
Pie chart data of actors’ original influence and corresponding table data are as follows:
\begin{figure}[H]

  \end{tabular}
\caption{Actor's origin influence}  
\end{minipage}  
\end{figure}

\subsection{Simulation and Analysis}
\subsubsection{First results}
As we cannot decide the real value of p, we suppose p to be 0.5 which means that the original influence 
and the attached influence are equally weighted. According to our model and algorithm, we have
 found actor Anthony Perry is the most influential actor in the actor network whose sum influence 
 reaches 0.154184, followed by Eric Tsang and Daniel Wu (0.154844 and 0.137581 respectively). 
 The specific influence ranking when p=0.5 are as figure\eqref{fig:gpz5}:
 \begin{figure}[H]
\small
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{3.png}
\caption{sum influence of movie actors(p=0.5)} \label{fig:gpz5}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Effect of different p value}
To make our model more reliable and accurate, we need to discuss our results with different double-weighting
 factor p. In this case, we use the algorithm in our model to figure out the sum influence of movie 
 actors with different p value. We adopt line graph to make our outcome more vivid. \cite{7}
  \begin{figure}[H]
\centering  
\includegraphics[width=7in,height=4in]{1.jpg}  
\centering  
\caption{Sum influence of movie actors with different p value}  
\end{figure}
 ~\\
 In addition, according to our experiment data, we find that total sum influence in the network 
 decreases with increasing p value. This can be seen from the bar chart below. To explain the
 phenomenon, we think the reason is that the weight of attached influence shows a downward trend 
 when value of p increases.
 
\subsubsection{Simulation: The promotion of the model}
In process of model building, we have used many network techniques to empower our model. 
To apply our model into generic network influence-ranking problems, we need to estimate accurate
 p value in specific networks. Hence, we state a general approach, by which can measure network
 influence as follows:\\
First, perform statistics of various network on the network analyzed to estimate p value of that network.
Then, according to features of specified network, transform them into original influence and attached
 influence about nodes just like what we do in our model. \\
Finally, combine both of them together to figure out the sum influence. Thus, we can measure the
 influence and impact within general network based on our model and algorithm.

\section{Application within Networks}%5.1确认模型，使之合理。
\subsection{Our Goal}
\begin{itemize} 
\item  To calculate how the individuals choose collaboration partners in the network to make his influence get maximum
 promotion through the network influence model we have created.
\item To make one given network system’s transmission result maximum by using the network influence model we have created.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Maximizing Influence}
\begin{itemize}
\item 　In a network that is in some certain area, we want to choose a number of nodes in it to develop relationships with
 ourselves in order to improve ourselves’ influence as high as possible. We can assume that there are m nodes in the network,
 we use the PRNM model to calculate the influence $x_{i}$ of  node i , then we denote the influence that node I shared
 with other nodes that are connected with node I by $Y_{i},Y_{i}=X_{i}/n,$ n is the number of the nodes that connect with node I,
 then we arrange y in order of descending.\\
 \indent
 ~\\
 If our target is to select k nodes in the network to develop relationships with
 ourselves to improve ourselves’ influence as high as possible, So it is more suitable for us to select the first k nodes. \cite{8}
 ~\\
 ~\\
 ~\\
\item  We use the MaxDgree algorithm\cite{9} (also be called the MDA algorithm) to calculate a network’s maximum influence, 
which has on greatest advantage that has a small time complexity, and it has the ability to handle any kind of network.\\
~\\
　Because it just needs to collect some properties of network such as degree centrality, number of degrees when selecting
 initial activation node. Then utilize these properties of network to directly choose initial activation node with the number 
 of K.\\
 ~\\
 \indent
 Finally calculate theirs influences. The biggest disadvantage of the heuristic algorithm is the result of unstable solution.
 And its effect varies with the change of the internet. MaxDegree Algorithm is kind of simple and effective. \\
 ~\\
 It requires to directly
 choose K biggest node degree as the initial activation node at the rank of the internet. Therefore, in some cases, it is feasible
 to solve the problem of MaxInfluence by adopting MaxDegree Algorithm. On the one hand, it has a small time complexity,
 on the other hand, it shows great effects. Hereinafter is the detail description of the MaxDegree Algorithm. As shown in table
 \ref{table:mda}

 
 \begin{table}[H]
 \centering
 \caption{MaxDegree Algorithm}
 \label{table:mda}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\cellcolor{regular!20} Input: & Social network G and k initial activation nodes with the number of K \\
\hline
\cellcolor{regular!20} Output:& k nodes of the max-degree and sum number of affected nodes  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}   
\end{table}
\begin{codebox}
\Procname{$\proc{MaxDegree Algorithm}$}
\li  $\text{Social network G and k initial activation nodes with the number of K}$ 
\li $\text{readFile ( File*file ); // read network}$
\li $\text{buildModels (int model);//build~ IC ~model~ and ~LT ~model ~according~ to~ the~ parametres}$
\li    $\text{simulateMoeels(int model,int num);//simulate spred model}$
\li      $A \gets \varnothing .$
\li   $\text{  int sum=0;}$
\li  $A \gets maxDegree(k)$
\li    $     for (i=1 to M)$ 
\li $\text{sum=sum+F(A,G)}$
\li  $\text{end for}$  
\li       $ \text{  return A and sum/M}$        
\end{codebox}

\end{itemize}
　　　Obtain the function maxDegree(k) that has k nodes of the maximum degree,
 and use the direct selection algorithm and the time complexity is O(kn). And we prepare to obtain the node 
 assemblage F(A,$G_{r}$.) in the assemblage A from the propagation diagram叹. .  About the analysis of the reachability of each
 node, it can be accomplished in (s) that is the network diameter. The time complexity is mainly related to that algorithm 
 should be done M times, and hence its time complexity is the O$((kn-k^{2}/2)M)$, “n” is the node number, “k” is the initial given
 node number. Although the maxDegree algorithm can have a quick selection for the initial maximum influence node, 
 it has the flaw of penitential neighbor-overlap. In the figure \ref{fig:mda}, the social network which divided by dotted lines has two 
 communities, and obviously, the node connection in the community is relatively close, while the connections among
 communities are comparatively sparse. There are two initial maximum influence nodes. According to the maxDegree
 algorithm, node A and F are selected as the initial nodes. A is next to F node, and therefore, the nodes chosen by the
 maxDegree algorithm is overlapped. To solve this problem, each community should select one node as the initial maximum
 influence node and then the initial nodes are spread to each community, which pause a better and faster information
 transmission. 
\subsection{Model Optimizing}
 The two models we mentioned in 5.2 is a kind of optimization based on the original 
 model.In the fisrt model in 5.2,we firstly run the PRNM model to figure out every node’s S,then we share the node’s
 S to n people who has cooperated with the node evenly.And if we want to improve ourselves’ influence mostly,
 we could choose the person who can share more influence to others.And in second model 5.2,we use Maxdegree algorithm 
 to figure out the maximize influence of a network.

%================================第6章：总体评价==============================
\section{Conclusions}
Although Mr. Gore has expressed concerns to some associates about
the damage a brokered convention could cause, several associates
said he was hopeful that one candidate would soon break through,
sparing the party such an outcome. He told a close friend recently
that his decision not to endorse “feels like the right thing”
and that he remained optimistic the race “is going to tip at some
point,” the friend said.

\subsection{Sensitivity and Uncertainty Analysis }
Sensitivity analysis is the study of how the uncertainty in the output of our model can be apportioned to
 different sources of uncertainty in its inputs. When applying our model to measure influence and 
 impact in different networks, it is very difficult to guarantee the data that are completely “clean”, which
 means correct and complete. Fortunately, the sensitivity of PRNM model is very robust. PRNM not only
 considers the attached influence based on the relationship between nodes, but also analyzes node’s 
 original influence using given data. The result is likely to take into consideration the sum influence
 measures of every node. So changing or missing a few connections would not have big influence on
 our model.
Our model also considers some uncertain factors, such as the number of total nodes, specific measure
 methods of different relationship between nodes or other unexpected events. We have not included 
 the interference from external environment, which may be too complex for us to study. In the future
 we may find a better method, and then we will take more factors into our model.


%======模型=优点===========
\subsection{Strengths}
We use P-Rank Network Model to study and measure the influence and impact within networks. Advantages are listed as 
follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Comprehensive:}
we take both original influence and attached influence into consideration for network impact measures.
 Thus, the solution of our model pursues high credibility, while reducing the misjudgment rate.
\item \textbf{Extendable:}
the result of simulation shows that our model can be applied to other networks, not just research 
networks.
 \item \textbf{Reasonable:}
 the result of our model match well with the real situation, which proves the rationality and correctness 
 of our model.
  \item \textbf{Flexible::}
 the sensitivity of our model is very robust. Since everything may be an accident, our model has its 
 flexibility that allows the unexpected things to happen. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Weaknesses}
\begin{itemize}
\item Our model is creative and robust, however, we do not have enough data to verify our model
 although we have discussed the data required. Hence, the correctness of our model remains to be
 verified. 
 \item We use only one single effective parameter in our model: double-weighting factor p
 (that is, the relative weight of original influence), Sometimes this parameter are determined manually, 
 which could cause uncertainty of our model solutions and the priority will change to some extent if 
 different constant is set. Although we need to estimate the value of p in advance to validate the
 models’ stability, we still can’t explain why the way we set the value of p can guarantee the accordance
 of our model results to the reality.
 \item When analyzing different networks in our models, we actually only focus on limited fields. 
 So it is better if we have more detailed discuss about other network fields in addition to academic
 research or movie actors.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item We will apply our model into more complex network influence analysis to optimize the PRNM
 algorithm. And our model will be enhanced to a larger extent.
 \item Find enough data to verify our model in order to improve both the sensitivity and robustness
 of our model.
\end{itemize}
