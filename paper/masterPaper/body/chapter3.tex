算法流程图

算法伪代码如下:
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Navie Fair Sharing with Simple Delay Scheduling }
\begin{algorithmic}
\State Initialize j.skipcount to 0 for all jobs j.
\If{n has a free slot } 
\State sort jobs in increasing order of number of running tasks
	\For{j in jobs}
		\If{j has unlaunched task t with data on n }
		\State launch t on n
		\State j.skipcont = 0
			\ElsIf{j has unlaunched task t }
				\If{j.skipcount ≥ D}
				\State launch t on n
				\Else
				\State set j.skipcount = j.skipcount + 1
				\EndIf
		\EndIf
	\EndFor
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}

\end{algorithm}
